Hello and welcome to the Pilpel Lab Github!

GitHub is a great way to share and collaborate on code. It has embedded tools in RStudio, PyCharm and other programs.

If you are new to GitHub, please follow the (short) tutorials to learn about branches, commits, pulling code and pushing your changes into the repository: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world

“Vai! E se der medo, vai com medo mesmo” (Go! And if you are scared, go scared)
